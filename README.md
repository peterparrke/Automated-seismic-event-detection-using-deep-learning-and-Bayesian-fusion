This repository is the implementation of automated seismic events detection under faulty data interference of structural health monitoring. Packages dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. This program primarily comprises two components: the training of deep learning models and Bayesian data fusion. Owing to confidentiality protocols, the original datasets from the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system of the bridge have been omitted. Nonetheless, the dataset containing manually labeled for four seismic events, coupled with the corresponding outcomes derived from neural network analyses, is available in the `bayesian_fusion` directory. To initiate the data fusion processes, the `predict_using_previous_likeli.m` script, situated within the bayesian_fusion directory, should be executed.
