This repository is the implementation of automated seismic events detection under faulty data interference of structural health monitoring. Packages dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. This program primarily comprises two components: the training of deep learning models and Bayesian data fusion.However, the manually annotated data for the four seismic events and the results identified by the neural network have been placed in the bayesian_fusion folder, which can be accessed by running predict_using_previous_likeli.m for data fusion.
